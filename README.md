# Animal Detection

### Being developed

## Overview

Welcome to the Animal Detection project. This is the deep learning model that was trained to detect various stray animals and wild animals that we might encounter. I have used the MobileNet V2 boject detection model and trained it to detect both stray and wild animals.

This model can be deployed in cloud, local server or in edge devices to perform the task of detecting animals. MobileNet is very lightweight and computationally efficient. This makes right candidate to train and deploy it in various platforms.

Video feeds from the CCTV cameras can eaily be inferenced using the trained model and once the object is detedcted it can alert the authorities using some form of communication system. While building this project, I initially used SMS api to perform the alert.
